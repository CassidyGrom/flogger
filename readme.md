# The Feelings Journal

## Purpose
Therapists and counselors often ask people to recount a moment in their day then identify how it made them feel. Regularly practicing this increases emotional awareness.

In our app, the Feelings Journal, we mimic this therapy process. We used a list of 25 primary emotions and over 100 secondary emotions from the Center For Nonviolent Communication,  Users are asked to login, create a quick journal entry each day, then reflect on their past journals, looking for trends and insights.
